# Assignment-1-Code
In part one of the assignment I only had html.
  In that part one I had 5 webpages in which only 2 contained forms.

In part 2 added CSS styling.
  During this phase I added alot more images and as well as a nother webpage the adoption page.

In part 3 I added functionality using Java Scrtipt.
   Using JavaScripts I added validation rules to all of my form.
   I also added features to my donation page, for example a tracker which tracks the amount of money which has
   bee donated as well as a feature which allows the user to print a reciept after donting.
